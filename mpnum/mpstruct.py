    :class:`~mpnum.mparray.MPArray`\ .

    The local tensors are kept in ``_ltens``\ , a list of
    :class:`numpy.ndarray`\ s such that ``_ltens[i]`` corresponds to the
    local tensor of site `i`\ .

    If there are :math:`k` (non-virtual) indices at site :math:`i`, the
    corresponding local tensor is a ndarray with ``ndim == k + 2``. The two
    additional indices of the local tensor correspond to the virtual legs. We
    reserve the `0`\ th index of the local tensor for the virtal leg coupling
    to site :math:`i - 1` and the last index for the virtual leg coupling to
    site :math:`i + 1`.

    Therefore, if the physical legs at site :math:`i` have dimensions
    :math:`d_1, \ldots, d_k`, the corresponding local tensor has shape
    :math:`(r_{i-1}, d_1, \ldots, d_k, r_{i})`. Here, :math:`r_{i-1}` and
    :math:`r_i` denote the rank between sites :math:`(i - 1, i)` and
    :math:`(i, i + 1)`, respectively.

    To keep the data structure consistent, we include the left virutal leg of
    the leftmost local tensor as well as the right virtual leg of the rightmost
    local tensor as dummy indices of dimension 1.
